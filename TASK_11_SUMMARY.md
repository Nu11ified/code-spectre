### 4. Enhanced Admin API (`src/server/api/routers/admin.ts`)

#### New Security Endpoints
- **Security Audit**: `performSecurityAudit` - Comprehensive system security analysis
- **Terminal Command Validation**: `validateTerminalCommand` - Test command security
- **File Access Validation**: `validateFileAccess` - Test file access permissions
- **Network Access Validation**: `validateNetworkAccess` - Test network access permissions

#### Enhanced Security Dashboard
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live security metrics and violation tracking
- **Audit Results**: Comprehensive security audit results display
- **Risk Assessment**: Visual risk level indicators and compliance status
- **Violation Details**: Detailed security violation information with recommendations

### 5. Security Setup Infrastructure (`scripts/setup-security.sh`)

#### Network Security
- **Isolated Docker Network**: Created `cloud-ide-isolated` network with no external connectivity
- **Network Configuration**: Disabled inter-container communication and IP masquerading
- **DNS Control**: Controlled DNS servers and disabled search domains

#### Security Profiles
- **AppArmor Profile**: Comprehensive AppArmor profile for container security
- **Seccomp Profile**: Detailed seccomp profile restricting dangerous system calls
- **Security Configuration**: JSON configuration file with security policies

#### Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Security Monitor Script**: Automated security monitoring with resource and network checks
- **Systemd Service**: Optional systemd service for continuous security monitoring
- **Log Rotation**: Automated log rotation for security logs
- **Alert System**: Security violation alerting and logging

### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`src/server/services/__tests__/security.test.ts`)

#### Security Feature Tests
- **File Access Validation**: Tests for file system access control
- **Network Access Validation**: Tests for network access restrictions
- **Container Escape Detection**: Tests for escape attempt detection
- **Enhanced Terminal Validation**: Tests for dangerous pattern detection
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Tests for directory traversal blocking
- **Restricted Path Access**: Tests for system path access prevention
