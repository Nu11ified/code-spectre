# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cloud IDE Orchestrator is a multi-tenant, self-hosted platform that provides secure, isolated development environments for teams. The system acts as a "front door" that dynamically launches and manages per-user, per-branch IDE containers using code-server (VS Code in the browser). This platform enables organizations to maintain code ownership while providing developers with full-featured development environments accessible from any browser.

The core value proposition is providing a secure, managed IDE environment where users can work on specific repository branches without the ability to clone or access unauthorized code, while maintaining the full VS Code experience with extensions, terminals, and collaborative features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate using my GitHub account, so that I can access authorized repositories and branches through the web-based IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL present a GitHub OAuth login option
2. WHEN a user completes GitHub OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL create or update their user profile with GitHub information
3. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their personal dashboard
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user permissions and repository access, so that I can control who can access which repositories and with what level of access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display all users and their current roles
2. WHEN an admin adds a new repository THEN the system SHALL validate the Git URL and store repository metadata
3. WHEN an admin assigns repository permissions to a user THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of branch creation limits, allowed base branches, and terminal access
4. WHEN an admin modifies user permissions THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce the new permissions for active sessions
5. IF a user is not an admin THEN the system SHALL deny access to administrative functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view my accessible repositories and branches, so that I can select which codebase I want to work on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only repositories they have permission to access
2. WHEN a user selects a repository THEN the system SHALL fetch and display available branches from the Git repository
3. WHEN a user wants to create a new branch THEN the system SHALL enforce naming conventions (feat/, fix/, etc.) and base branch restrictions
4. IF a user exceeds their branch creation limit THEN the system SHALL prevent branch creation and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to launch an isolated IDE environment for a specific branch, so that I can develop code securely without accessing unauthorized files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Launch IDE" for a branch THEN the system SHALL verify their permissions for that repository and branch
2. WHEN launching an IDE THEN the system SHALL create a Docker container with code-server mounting only the specified branch worktree
3. WHEN the IDE container starts THEN the system SHALL provide a unique URL for accessing the user's private IDE session
4. WHEN a user accesses their IDE session THEN the system SHALL present a full VS Code interface with pre-installed extensions
5. IF a user lacks permission for a branch THEN the system SHALL deny IDE access and display an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage global IDE extensions and configurations, so that all users have access to necessary development tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses extension management THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to search and install VS Code extensions
2. WHEN an admin installs an extension THEN the system SHALL make it available to all new IDE sessions
3. WHEN an admin configures global IDE settings THEN the system SHALL apply these settings to new container instances
4. WHEN extensions are updated THEN the system SHALL track versions and allow rollback if needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my code changes to be securely managed, so that I can commit and push changes without direct Git access to the host system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes code changes in their IDE THEN the system SHALL isolate these changes within their container
2. WHEN a user commits changes THEN the system SHALL use secure deploy keys for Git operations
3. WHEN a user pushes changes THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the platform's Git credentials, not the user's personal credentials
4. IF a user attempts unauthorized Git operations THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and log the attempt

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor and manage active IDE sessions, so that I can ensure resource usage is controlled and sessions are properly cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views session management THEN the system SHALL display all active IDE containers with user and resource information
2. WHEN a session becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically stop and remove the container after a configurable timeout
3. WHEN an admin manually stops a session THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down the container and clean up resources
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL prevent new session creation and notify administrators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want terminal access within my IDE environment, so that I can run development commands and tools when authorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has terminal permissions THEN the system SHALL provide full terminal access within their container
2. WHEN a user lacks terminal permissions THEN the system SHALL disable terminal functionality in their IDE session
3. WHEN a user accesses the terminal THEN the system SHALL restrict access to only their branch worktree directory
4. IF a user attempts to access unauthorized directories THEN the system SHALL prevent the action through container isolation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to be scalable and maintainable, so that it can handle multiple users and repositories efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically configure reverse proxy routing for dynamic container access
2. WHEN containers are created THEN the system SHALL use resource limits to prevent any single session from consuming excessive resources
3. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and proper indexing for performance
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the platform to maintain strict isolation between users and repositories, so that sensitive code remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are created THEN the system SHALL mount only the specific branch worktree, preventing access to other branches or repositories
2. WHEN users work in their IDE THEN the system SHALL prevent network access to unauthorized services through container networking restrictions
3. WHEN Git operations occur THEN the system SHALL use dedicated deploy keys rather than user credentials
4. WHEN sessions end THEN the system SHALL completely remove container data and temporary files
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate the session and alert administrators
